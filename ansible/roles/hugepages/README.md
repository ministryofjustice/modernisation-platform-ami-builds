This role disables Transparent HugePages and configures HugePages according to this [guide](https://oracle-base.com/articles/linux/configuring-huge-pages-for-oracle-on-linux-64). However, the number of HugePages is set to 50% of RAM as per DBA guidance, rather than by using the script described in the above link.

The guide also mentions setting the memlock limits. These get set in `/etc/security/limits.conf` when the `oracle-rdbms-server-11gR2-preinstall-1.0-4moj.el7.x86_64.rpm` package is installed, albeit to an incorrect value. Rather than setting them here they are set to the correct value for the instance type in the user-data script when an instance is launched from the AMI.
